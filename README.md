# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Running the project

Versions used during development:

- node v22.13.1
- npm v10.9.2

Tools used during development:

- Windows, browser - chrome, edge (as well as dynamic resolution tool in both)
- IOS, browser - chrome, safari

```shell
## both in the same directory as package.json
npm install
npm run dev
## then simply open localhost:PORT (default is 5714, but double check in the output to be sure)
```
